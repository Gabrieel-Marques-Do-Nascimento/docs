# Introduction

**Sanny Builder** is a fast and powerful tool designed for the GTA 3D game series \(GTA3, VC, SA, LCS; partially VCS\).

It includes a disassembler, permitting the end-user to transform the game scripts into text. The compiler feature offers a convenient editor with a large number of useful functions such as syntax highlighting, error checking, advanced search tools, player coordinates reading, fast movement through code and much more.

Sanny offers an advanced code syntax which is similar to existing programming languages. This syntax includes changeable classes, keywords and high-level statements. We recommend you continue reading and fully explore the help section to learn more about SB and its capabilities. We provide a wealth of information that will help you get started in mission coding.

## **Installation and Updates**

Run the installer and follow its instructions. During installation you could optionally select the game directory you plan to work with, associate files with the .SCM extension with Sanny Builder and install the CLEO library. All these settings you always can change in the program options.

To uninstall the program, run the file unins000.exe located in its root folder.

Latest versions and updates are always available at [sannybuilder.com](https://sannybuilder.com/)

## Command line usage

\sa - run as SA editor \(default\)  
\vc - run as VC editor  
\gta3 - run as GTA3 editor  
\lcs - run as LCS editor  
\vcs - run as VCS editor  
\sa\_mobile - run as SA Mobile editor.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can change the current edit mode in run-time.
{% endhint %}

\debug - enables the debug options  
  
\compile input\_file\_path \[output\_file\_path\] - run compilation in hidden mode at the program startup  
`Example: \compile C:\myscm.txt C:\myscm.scm`

{% hint style="info" %}
An _output\_file\_path_ parameter is optional. If there is no path specified for an output file, the compiler uses name formats. Pay attention that the source file must have no errors. If at compilation there will be errors, they will be logged in the file compile.log. When compilation ends, the program shuts down.
{% endhint %}

\nosplash - run the program without the startup screen
