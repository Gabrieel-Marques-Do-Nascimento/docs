# 0076: Condition expected

`WHILE..END` and `REPEAT..UNTIL` require at least one conditional command or the constants `True` or `False` but none were found.

**Possible solutions:** fulfill the loop syntax with a conditional command or `True` or `False`:

```text
while // error, a condition missing
    wait 0
end

while true // OK
    wait 0
end
```
