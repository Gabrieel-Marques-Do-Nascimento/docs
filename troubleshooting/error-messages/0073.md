# 0073: Redundant logical operator

A [conditional statement](../../coding/conditions.md) has one condition and there is a logical operator \(**AND** or **OR**\). A logical operator is only needed for multiple conditions. It may signal a possible error that some conditions were missing.

**Possible solutions:** change this statement: either add missing conditions, or get rid of the operator:

```text
if and
  0@ == 1 // error, logical operator is used for a single condition
then
  //
end

if
  0@ == 1 // OK
then
  //
end

if and
  0@ == 1
  1@ == 1 // OK
then
  //
end
```
