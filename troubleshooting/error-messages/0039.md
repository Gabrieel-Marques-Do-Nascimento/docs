# 0039: Could not read declaration

The compiler can't properly read a mission or external script declaration in the header. It may happen if a string value is used where an integer number is expected.

**Possible solutions:** fix the declaration:

```text
DEFINE MISSION "0" at @label // error, integer id expected
DEFINE MISSION 0 at @label // OK
```
