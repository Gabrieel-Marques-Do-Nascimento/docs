# 0029: Could not read a debug script ID

The compiler can't read the parameter value of the opcode `05B6`. 

This opcode references a chunk of debug data left by the developers in the scripts of GTA San Andreas . This opcode and the data it references have no special meaning in runtime and are left in the disassembled code only to preserve one-to-one match with the original script.

**Possible solutions:** use the number produced by the disassembler, or delete this opcode from the script.
