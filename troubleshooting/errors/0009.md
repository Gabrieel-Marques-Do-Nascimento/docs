# 0009: Opcodes list not found

Disassembler or compiler can't work without [opcodes definitions](../../edit-modes/opcodes-list-scm.ini.md) \(see [0001](0001.md)\).

**Possible solutions:** check if the path to the INI file has been set in the [options](../../editor/options/general.md#opcodes-path) and the file exists.
