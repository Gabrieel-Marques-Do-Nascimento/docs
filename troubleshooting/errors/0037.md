# 0037: Debug script not found

The parameter value of the opcode `05B6` is too high.

This opcode references a chunk of debug data left by the game developers. This data is cached in `*.bin` files in the Sanny Builder directory. It has no special meaning in runtime and is left in the disassembled code only to preserve one-to-one match with the original script.

**Possible solutions:** use the number produced by the disassembler, or delete this opcode from the script.
