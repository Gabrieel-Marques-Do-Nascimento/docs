# 0087: Invalid aDMA variable

The compiler finds an `aDMA` [variable](../../coding/data-types.md#variables) that is not a multiple of `4` and the [edit mode](../../edit-modes/) targets Liberty City Stories or Vice City Stories.

Data types in Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories games limit addressing variables storage to only offsets that are multiples of `4`.

**Possible solutions:** change the variable to be a multiple of `4`: 

```text
&3 = 0 // error
&4 = 0 // OK
```
