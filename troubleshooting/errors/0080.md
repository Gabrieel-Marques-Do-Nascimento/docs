# 0080: Non-negative integer number expected

The compiler expects a number greater than or equal to `0` but finds something different. 

For example, the error could be thrown if a negative number is used for the array [element index](../../coding/arrays.md#accessing-array-elements-after-declaration) or as the second parameter to the [Alloc](../../coding/built-in-commands.md#alloc) command.

**Possible solutions:** use a positive integer number:

```text
$var[-1] = 0 // error
$var[1] = 0 // OK
```
