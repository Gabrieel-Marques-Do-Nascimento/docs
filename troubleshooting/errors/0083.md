# 0083: Unknown model ID

The compiler can't resolve an ID of the model. 

It may happen in a header-less script \(i.e. a CLEO script or any script compiled with the `{$EXTERNAL}` [directive](../../coding/directives.md#usdexternal)\) where all models must be compiled using their global ID as defined in an `.ide` file. By default the compiler only scans `vehicles.ide`, `peds.ide`, `default.ide` for model ids.

A notable effect of this error would be an info pickup seen in-game instead of the expected model.

**Possible solutions:** use a numeric identifier \(ID\) instead of the model name. To find the ID use the Sanny's built-in [conversion tool](../../editor/options/hotkeys.md) \(`Ctrl+Alt+H`\):

```text
{$CLEO}

0107: $o = create_object #KEYCARD at 0 0 0 // error, can find KEYCARD
0107: $o = create_object 1581 at 0 0 0 // OK
```
