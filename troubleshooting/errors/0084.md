# 0084: Jump to zero offset

A header-less script has the `jump` or `jump_if_false` command that transfers the control flow to offset `0`. The game considers `0` as a global offset and it continues executing commands from the beginning of the `main.scm` \(as opposed to negative offsets that are relative to the current script\).

A visible effect of this bug is that the game "reloads" \(as if a new game started\).

**Possible solutions:** add opcode `0000:` as the very first instruction:

```text
{$CLEO}
while true
    wait 0
end // error, jump 0


{$CLEO}
0000:
while true
    wait 0
end // OK, jump -2
```
